BST

Binary Search Tree of black list IPs. 
The purpose of our function is to determine either we find the source or the destination of the message in the black list(the BST).
For convenience, we are going to represent the black list IPs as numbers, and the message contains only two numbers that represents the source and destination.

Input: root, message(source, destination)
Output: Valid/ Invalid (enum)
